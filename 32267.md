NIP-32267
=========

Software Applications and Project Management
--------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines a set of addressable (parameterized-replaceable) events for describing software applications/projects and their milestone/task structure on Nostr.

All events defined here are addressable per [NIP-01](01.md) and therefore replaceable by `kind + pubkey + d` identifier. Producers SHOULD keep the same `d` value for the lifetime of an entity and publish updates by creating a newer event with the same triplet. Consumers SHOULD treat the latest version (by `created_at`, breaking ties by lowest id) as the canonical one.

Motivation
----------

Many applications would like to express project metadata, milestones, and tasks directly on Nostr so they can be indexed, searched, and curated across clients. This NIP specifies simple interoperable shapes that use existing tags and conventions where possible.

Kinds Overview
--------------

- `32267`: Software Application (addressable)
- `32300`: Project (addressable)
- `32301`: Milestone (addressable)
- `32302`: Task (addressable)

Linking Conventions
-------------------

- When linking to another addressable or replaceable event, producers SHOULD include an `a` tag that points to the target's coordinates (`"<kind>:<pubkey>:<d>"` for addressable, or `"<kind>:<pubkey>:"` for normal replaceable) as defined in [NIP-01](01.md). They MAY also include an `e` tag that references the specific event id for easier discovery and threading; clients SHOULD prefer the `a` tag for stable resolution.
- Single-letter tags (like `a`, `e`, `p`, `t`, `s`) SHOULD be preferred to ease relay indexing (see [NIP-01](01.md)).

Common/Reusable Tags
--------------------

This NIP reuses a number of existing tags from other NIPs to avoid duplication:

- `name` — a human-readable name (see usage in [NIP-34](34.md), [NIP-58](58.md), [NIP-72](72.md), etc.)
- `description` — a human-readable description (see [NIP-34](34.md), [NIP-58](58.md))
- `image` — image URL, optional dimensions (see [NIP-58](58.md))
- `web` — website URL (see [NIP-34](34.md))
- `repo` — repository URL (see [NIP-34](34.md), [NIP-C0](C0.md))
- `license` — license identifier or URL (see [NIP-C0](C0.md))
- `t` — hashtags/labels (see [NIP-24](24.md))
- `p` — pubkey(s), e.g., owners/maintainers/assignees (see [NIP-01](01.md))
- `s` — status (this NIP constrains values for Tasks; see below). This reuses the `s` tag name used elsewhere as “status” ([NIP-69](69.md)).

This NIP introduces three additional, optional tags for planning metadata:

- `due` — a due date as Unix timestamp (string) or ISO-8601 date string
- `priority` — one of `low`, `medium`, `high` or a client-defined integer
- `points` — story points or effort estimate as a stringified number

Producers MAY include richer, app-specific JSON in `.content` (e.g., markdown descriptions or structured metadata) while keeping critical indexing data in tags.

Kind 32267 — Software Application (addressable)
-----------------------------------------------

Represents a software application (client, service, library, etc.). Multiple versions or editions SHOULD be expressed via the same `d` (stable identifier) and updated over time, or via distinct `d` values when fundamentally different applications.

Required:

- `"d"` — application identifier, e.g., reverse-DNS (`"com.example.app"`) or a unique slug
- `"name"` — display name

Recommended tags:

- `"description"` — short description
- `"image"` — icon/hero image URL (with optional width/height as extra tag params)
- `"web"` — homepage URL
- `"repo"` — source repository URL
- `"license"` — license identifier or URL
- `"t"` — one or more category tags (e.g., `nostr`, `wallet`, `client`)
- `"p"` — pubkeys of maintainers/owners

Content:

- Free-form, MAY contain markdown, release notes, or extended description

Example:

```json
{
  "kind": 32267,
  "created_at": 1737052800,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "com.example.app"],
    ["name", "Example App"],
    ["description", "An example nostr-enabled application."],
    ["image", "https://example.com/icon.png", "512x512"],
    ["web", "https://example.com"],
    ["repo", "https://github.com/example/app"],
    ["license", "MIT"],
    ["t", "nostr"],
    ["t", "client"],
    ["p", "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"]
  ],
  "content": "Longer markdown description here"
}
```

Kind 32300 — Project (addressable)
----------------------------------

Represents a specific project (which MAY correspond to or complement a `32267` Software Application). Multiple projects per pubkey are supported via distinct `d` values.

Required:

- `"d"` — project identifier slug (unique per author)
- `"name"` — project name

Recommended tags:

- `"description"`
- `"image"`
- `"t"` — topic labels
- `"p"` — owners/maintainers
- `"a"` — optional pointer to a related Software Application `32267` event

Content:

- Free-form; MAY contain full README/overview in markdown

Example:

```json
{
  "kind": 32300,
  "created_at": 1737052801,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "example-project"],
    ["name", "Example Project"],
    ["description", "A project within Example App"],
    ["t", "feature"],
    ["t", "ui"],
    ["a", "32267:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:com.example.app"]
  ],
  "content": "Project overview, goals, scope."
}
```

Kind 32301 — Milestone (addressable)
------------------------------------

Represents a milestone within a project.

Required:

- `"d"` — milestone identifier slug (unique per author+project)
- Link to parent project using `"a"` tag; producers MAY also include an `"e"` tag with the project event id if known

Recommended tags:

- `"name"`, `"description"`
- `"due"` — due date
- `"t"` — labels

Content:

- Free-form milestone plan/notes

Example:

```json
{
  "kind": 32301,
  "created_at": 1737052802,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "v1-beta"],
    ["name", "v1 beta"],
    ["description", "Beta milestone"],
    ["due", "1739664000"],
    ["a", "32300:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:example-project"],
    ["t", "beta"]
  ],
  "content": "Checklist and narrative for the milestone."
}
```

Kind 32302 — Task (addressable)
--------------------------------

Represents a task within a milestone. Tasks can be created/updated by any author; clients may apply their own authorization/ownership policies.

Required:

- `"d"` — task identifier slug (unique per author+milestone)
- Link to parent milestone using `"a"` tag; producers MAY also include an `"e"` tag with the milestone event id if known

Recommended tags:

- `"name"`, `"description"`
- `"s"` — status: one of `todo`, `in-progress`, `done`, `blocked`, `canceled`
- `"p"` — assignee(s)
- `"priority"` — `low` | `medium` | `high` or integer
- `"due"` — due date
- `"points"` — story points or estimate
- `"t"` — labels

Content:

- Free-form; MAY include acceptance criteria, discussion, or references

Example:

```json
{
  "kind": 32302,
  "created_at": 1737052803,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "onboarding-flow"],
    ["name", "Implement onboarding flow"],
    ["description", "Create welcome screens and account setup"],
    ["a", "32301:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa:v1-beta"],
    ["s", "in-progress"],
    ["priority", "high"],
    ["due", "2025-01-31"],
    ["points", "5"],
    ["p", "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"],
    ["t", "ux"],
    ["t", "feature"]
  ],
  "content": "Acceptance criteria, notes, and links."
}
```

Client and Relay Behavior
-------------------------

- These kinds are addressable per [NIP-01](01.md). Relays SHOULD store only the most recent event per `kind+pubkey+d` and MAY discard older versions. In case of identical timestamps, retain the lowest id.
- Clients SHOULD link child entities with an `a` tag to ensure stable resolution across updates. Including an additional `e` tag is optional and can aid discovery.
- Clients MAY display `content` as markdown when present and fallback to tag-only summaries otherwise.
- Clients SHOULD gracefully handle missing or unknown tags and refrain from hard-failing on extra metadata.

Security and Privacy Considerations
-----------------------------------

- Public tasks and milestones are world-readable; avoid publishing sensitive info unencrypted. Private planning can leverage [NIP-44](44.md) encrypted payloads in `.content`, but note that relays and clients must support it for utility.
- Spoofing: anyone can create a project referring to any application; consumers should determine trust via pubkeys, social proofs ([NIP-05](05.md)), or curated lists ([NIP-51](51.md)).
- Phishing/malware: do not trust `web`, `repo`, or `image` links blindly. Clients MAY warn users when following external links.

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

This NIP reuses existing tags and the addressable-event conventions from [NIP-01](01.md). Clients not aware of these kinds can still render them as generic events.
